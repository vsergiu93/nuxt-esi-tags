# Nuxt ESI Tags Module

The nuxt-esi-tags module is specifically designed to bring enhanced server-side rendering capabilities to your 
Nuxt.js applications through the integration of Edge Side Includes (ESI). 
This is achieved by leveraging the Nuxt.js [Island Components](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/components#server-components) 
functionality to provide efficient, granular component rendering and caching, enhancing the robustness of large-scale 
applications containing reusable components.
